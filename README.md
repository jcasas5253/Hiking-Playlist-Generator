# Hiking Playlist Generator

### Concept
* Simply enter your hiking destination to find local hikes in the area with information about location, difficulty, rating, etc.
* The generate playlist button will create a playlist for the user based on the difficulty of the hike. 
* If the user enjoys the hike they chose, then they can hit a like button to let others know.

### Motivation
* Playing various types of music when hiking
* Not wasting time looking for songs
* Being able to have different types of genres based on the difficulty of the hike
* Every trail will play different playlist
* Never get bored on a trail
* Keeps you motivated through the hike

### Techonologies Used
* HTML, CSS
* Javascript, jQuery
* Materialize (NavBar, Buttons, Modal, and etc.)
* AJAX
* Google Geocoding API (City name or Zip code -> Latitude & Longitude)
* Hiking Project API  (Latitude & Longitude -> Trails information)
* iTunes player iFrame (Play pre-selected playlist depends on trail level)
* Firebase (Keep track of how many times “LIKE” button has been clicked for each trail)
